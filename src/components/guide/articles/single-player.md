## Single-Player Drafts

Single-player mode enables you to practice drafting in a simulated environment. Even though it doesn't afford you the opportunity to play games, you can still get valuable practice evaluating cards, reading signals, and building decks. It's also a great way to get to know a new set before drafting against real opponents.

### Getting Started

To start a new single-player draft, go to the [Draft](/draft/) page, select the set you want to draft from, and click the **Start Draft** button (it's fine to accept the defaults for the other options):

</p>

Once you've started a draft, you can leave and return later to finish (so long as you are using the same browser you initiated the draft from). Draftpod will keep your last several drafts in case you want to refer back to them or refine the decks you've built from them.

### Card Ratings

If you are getting to know a new set, it's sometimes interesting to see how your picks compare to the card ratings used internally by draftpod.

You can enable card ratings by selecting it as an option when starting a new draft. In this mode, there is a **Ratings** pane that will appear alongside the **Picks** pane which you can optionally display when evaluating cards in a pack:

<p>

</p>

Note that this view is not visible by default so you'll never see the ratings for a pack if you don't explicitly choose to do so.

When a set is first released, the card ratings are based on the P1P1 community evaluations available from [Draftaholics Anonymous](https://draftaholicsanonymous.com/). Subsequently, we collect data on the picks made during Draftpod drafts, and modify the ratings to reflect pick orders observed over time. 

While card ratings provide a rough idea of the relative power level between cards, they don't necessarily reflect optimal draft selections. The pick rating displayed reflects a baseline card rating plus a bonus for matching the color of the deck (the bonuses are lower in pack 1). Ratings don't reflect draft signals, deck synergies, mana curve, and creature/spell ratio&mdash;these considerations will often result in a pick different than the highest rated card.

### Bot Colors

One of the most important skills in drafting is reading the signals provided by other drafters about what colors are "open" and thus more likely to yield higher quality cards as the draft proceeds. While the techniques for doing this are beyond the scope of this guide, you can learn the basics from the articles [Signals in Booster Draft](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/level-one/signals-booster-draft-2015-01-19) by Reid Duke and [Drafting the Hard Way](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/stark-reality-drafting-the-hard-way/) by Ben Stark.

If you are using draftpod to practice reading signals, at the end of the draft you'll naturally want to see how you did. You can view the 2 main colors drafted by bots at the table using the **Players** menu on the main toolbar:

<p>

</p>

Note that bot colors by default only appear at the end of the draft. If however you are conducting a practice session where you are only concerned with reading signals, you may want to reveal the colors after the first pack. You can do this by clicking the **Show bot colors** link at any point during the draft:

<p>
<img src="/images/guide/show-bot-colors.png" width="100%" />
</p>

If you are practicing reading signals often just seeing bot colors after pack 1 provides enough feedback to let you know whether you've read things correctly.

### Reviewing Drafts

If you want to review and analyze your draft after it's complete, you can download a draft log and deck list using the **Download** button within the deck builder:

<p>
<img src="/images/guide/download-deck.png" width="100%" />
</p>

The download includes 2 files:

- **Draftlog.txt** &mdash; A log of every pick made in the draft
- **Decklist.txt** &mdash; List of main deck and sideboard cards
         

These files can in turn be uploaded to these websites, both of which allow you to view a pick-by-pick replay of your draft:
