## Privacy Notice

Draftpod is very careful about the collection and use of personal information. Any information we do collect is only used to operate Draftpod. We don't sell or trade visitor information with other companies.

This document provides details about what kind of data Draftpod gathers and how we manage it.

### Contact Form

The Draftpod [contact form](/guide#contact/) requests that you provide your name and email address. This information is used only for following up on requests via email. 

### Community Forum

The [Draftpod Forum](https://forum.draftpod.io/) is hosted on [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). See the forum [Privacy Policy](https://forum.draftpod.io/t/privacy-policy/6) for additional details on how Discourse handles information.

### Error Reporting

When errors occur within Draftpod, a log of the error is sent to the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) error-reporting service. Error reports also include various types of system diagnostic information (e.g. browser version, operating system, etc.). This information is used only for diagnosing and fixing errors which occur in the service.

### Analytics Data

When you use Draftpod, we collect statistical data about the device and network you used to access the site. We also collect behavior data. For example, we keep track of which buttons and links people click to get around on the site and how often they come back.

This information is stored with [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics) and is anonymized and aggregated. Only Draftpod administrators have access to our analytics data. We collect this information so that we can make better decisions about how to improve Draftpod. We never sell or trade this information to any other company.

Opt-out: You have the option to [opt-out of Google Analytics](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) using their browser extension or any of the available content blocking plugins for your platform.

Opt-out: You can set a [Do Not Track](https://allaboutdnt.com/) setting in your browser, which Google Analytics will honor.

### Draft Data

Draftpod stores an archive of the most recent 10 drafts within your browser's local storage. This data is only available to your browser and is not transmitted to Draftpod.

In order to conduct multi-player drafts, Draftpod stores the current state of the draft table within a [Google Cloud Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) document. The player data within the stored draft table includes a user-provided first name, but no other personally identifiable information.

When drafts are completed, Draftpod logs the order of picks within the draft for subsequent analysis (e.g. to improve card ratings and develop improved bot drafters). This data is completely anonymous (there is no way to tie it back to the person or browser that originated it). The data is stored within a [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) bucket.
