## Welcome to draftpod 

[Booster Draft](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft) is one of the most enjoyable ways to play Magic, however drafts typically require 6-8 players.  A draft simulator allows you draft by yourself (for practice), or to conduct drafts with smaller groups of players,  in which case simulated players (draft bots) take the other seats at the table.

We think that drafting is the best way to play Magic, and wanted to make it as easy as possible to both practice and play in small groups. We've tried 2 or 3 player formats like [Winston Draft](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Winston_Draft) but have found them unsatisfying, since they don't well approximate the cardpool and strategy of a full 8-player draft. 

Our hope is that with draftpod, any 2 Magic players that want to draft can do so without compromising on the depth of strategy and skill that makes drafting such a great gaming experience.
