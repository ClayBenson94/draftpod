[Booster Draft](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft) is one of the most enjoyable ways to play Magic. In fact, drafting is one of the best gaming experiences that you can find anywhere!

Traditionally, the only ways to draft were to pull together a group of 6-8 players, attend a [store event](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/friday-night-magic), or queue into an [MTGO Draft League](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-limited-events). More recently, [MTG Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena), has been offering a fantastic solo-drafting experience (you draft against bots and then play games against real opponents online).

But what about playing at home on the kitchen table? What about getting together with a friend for a beer and some Magic? What if you want to draft whenever you play Magic, even if you have only a couple of players? We developed mtglimited.net to make this possible.

mtglimited.net provides a simulator that enables you to conduct drafts with 2 or 3 players, in which case simulated players (draft bots) take the other seats at the table. When the draft is complete, you use the resulting deck lists to either assemble decks from a paper set cube, or play games online using MTG Arena [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ).

There is also a single-player mode that enables you to practice evaluating cards, reading signals, and building decks. 

Our hope is that mtglimited.net will provide a great way for 2, 3, or 4 players to draft without compromising on the depth of strategy and skill that makes drafting such a great gaming experience. We also hope it will be a valuable learning resource for players trying to improve their skills.

If you are interested in solo-practice, check out the article on [Single-Player](/guide/#single-player) mode. If you want to simulate 8-player drafts, see the article on [Multi-Player](/guide/#multi-player) mode.

mtglimited.net also supports sealed play (where each player builds a deck from a distinct set of 6 or more packs). Check out the article on [Sealed Deck](/guide#sealed/) format to learn more.
