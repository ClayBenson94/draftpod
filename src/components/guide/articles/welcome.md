[Booster Draft](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft) is one of the most enjoyable ways to play Magic, however drafts typically require 6-8 players.  A draft simulator allows you draft by yourself (for practice), or to conduct drafts with smaller groups of players,  in which case simulated players (draft bots) take the other seats at the table.

Our hope is that Draftpod will be both a learning resource for players trying to improve their skills, as well as a great way for 2, 3, or 4 players to draft without compromising on the depth of strategy and skill that makes drafting such a great gaming experience.
