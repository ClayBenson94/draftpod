Limited is a great way to play Magic&mdash;everyone starts with the same resources and you get a fresh deck building challenge every time. So why not play limited all the time? 

This site provides a simulator that enables you to conduct [Multi-Player](/guide/#multi-player) drafts with 2 or 3 players, in which case simulated players (draft bots) take the other seats at the table. When the draft is complete, you use the resulting deck lists to either assemble decks from a paper set cube, or play games online using [Arena Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ).

Sealed play, where each player builds a deck from a distinct set of 6 or more packs, is also supported. This is a great way to build and play with a wide variety of decks, while still keeping the available resources (number of packs) constant across players. Check out the article on [Sealed Deck](/guide#sealed/) to learn more.

There is also a [Single-Player](/guide/#single-player) mode that enables you to practice evaluating cards, reading signals, and building decks. 

Playing with paper cards and on MTG Arena are both supported. For paper, your set cube is digitally shuffled into a brand new set of packs every time you play. This is a great way to get replay value out of a booster box. On Arena, you use your existing collection (and wildcards when necessary) to create decks for online play.
