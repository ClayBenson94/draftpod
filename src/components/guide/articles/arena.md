## MTG Arena

MTG Arena includes a [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ) mode that enables you to initiate games directly with friends. You can use this feature to play with the decks you draft or build from a sealed pool.

To play games on MTG Arena, you will need to have a reasonably complete collection of cards (and/or available wildcards) for the set you are using. If you play and draft frequently on Arena, it's likely that your collection is already complete enough.

### Getting Started

To start a new draft for play on Arena, select the 4/4/1/1 cardpool for the set you want to draft from (this will ensure that you can draft no more than the 4 copies of each common and uncommon in the set):

</p>

Then, proceed with the draft or sealed pool build as normal. 

### Deck Building

After you make all of your picks, you'll end up in deck-building mode where you specify which cards will make your main deck and sideboard. Once you've completed deck-building, click the **View Decklist** button to see a list of the cards in your deck and sideboard. You'll want to select the **MTGA Format** tab so you can copy the decklist in the format required by MTGA:

</p>

Note that Direct Challenge requires 60 card decks, whereas limited decks are 40 cards. To bridge this gap, MTG Arena decklists automatically expand your 40 card draft or sealed deck to 60 cards. For example, if you have 23 non-lands in your deck, 13 of them (selected at random) will be duplicated so that you end up with 36 non-lands. Note that the ratio between creatures and non-creatures in your deck will be preserved.

### Playing

Once you've copied your MTG Arena decklist to the clipboard, you can import it into Arena. You can do this in the **Decks** area of Arena (the **Import** button is at the bottom-left of the screen and will automatically import whatever deck is on the clipboard):

MTG Arena games should be initiated using the [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ) feature (accessible by clicking the crossed swords icon at the top right of the home screen):

Direct Challenge supports both Best of 1 and Best of 3 matches (you can set this using the **Challenge Options** menu at the top of the pane).
