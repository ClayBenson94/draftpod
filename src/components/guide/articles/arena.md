## MTG Arena

[MTG Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) offers a fantastic solo-drafting experience along with a system that allows you to play matches on-demand (you'll rarely wait more than a minute for a pairing). This is a terrific way to draft anytime and build your Arena collection.

At the same time, one of the game's most significant draws is it's social dimension. Playing Magic is a wonderful way to spend time with friends and family. Draftpod enables you to play draft and sealed with your friends on MTG Arena. After drafting or building your sealed deck on Draftpod, you can use Arena [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ) mode to play the match.

To play games on MTG Arena, you will need to have a reasonably complete collection of cards (and/or available wildcards) for the set you are using. If you play and draft frequently on Arena, it's likely that your collection is already complete enough.

### Getting Started

To get started with a draft or sealed deck for play on Arena, select a set to play with and then specify the **4/4/1/1** cardpool for the set (this will ensure that you can draft no more than the 4 copies of each common and uncommon in the set):

</p>

Then, choose the **Multiple Players** option:

</p>

Finally, copy the provided URL and send it to the other players you'd like to have join. 

Players should use a desktop, laptop or tablet rather than a mobile phone (since phones don't generally have large enough screens to accommodate the UI).

When a player joins, their name will appear in the players list. Once all of the players have joined, click **Start** to begin.


### Deck Building

After you make all of your picks, you'll end up in deck-building mode where you specify which cards will make your main deck and sideboard:

Once you've completed deck-building, click the **View Decklist** button to see a list of the cards in your deck and sideboard. You'll want to select the **MTGA Format** tab to view the listformat required by MTGA:

Use the **Copy to Clipboard** button to copy the MTG Arena decklist to the clipboard.

Note that Direct Challenge requires 60 card decks, whereas limited decks are typically 40 cards. To bridge this gap, MTG Arena decklists automatically expand your 40 card draft or sealed deck to 60 cards. For example, if you have 23 non-lands in your deck, 13 of them (selected at random) will be duplicated so that you end up with 36 non-lands. Note that the ratio between creatures and non-creatures in your deck will be preserved.

### Playing

Once you've copied your MTG Arena decklist to the clipboard, you can import it into Arena. You can do this in the **Decks** area of Arena (the **Import** button is at the bottom-left of the screen and will automatically import whatever deck is on the clipboard):

MTG Arena games should be initiated using the [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ) feature (accessible by clicking the crossed swords icon at the top right of the home screen):

Direct Challenge supports both Best of 1 and Best of 3 matches (you can set this using the **Challenge Options** menu at the top of the pane).
