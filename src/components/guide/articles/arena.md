## MTG Arena

[MTG Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) offers a fantastic solo-drafting experience along with a system that allows you to play matches on-demand (you'll rarely wait more than a minute for a pairing). This is a terrific way to draft anytime and build your Arena collection.

At the same time, one of the game's most significant draws is it's social dimension. Playing Magic is a wonderful way to spend time with friends and family. Now you can play draft and sealed
with your friends on Arena. After drafting or building your sealed deck, you can use [Arena Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ) mode to play the match.

To play games on MTG Arena, you will need to have a reasonably complete collection of cards (and/or available wildcards) for the set you are using. If you play and draft frequently on Arena, it's likely that your collection is already complete enough.

### Getting Started

To get started with a draft or sealed deck for play on Arena, select a set to play with and then specify the **6/3/1/1** cardpool for the set (specifying a larger number of commons and uncommons makes for better variety, and Arena 40-card decks permit more than 4 copies of a card):

</p>

Then, choose the **Multiple Players** option:

</p>

Finally, copy the provided URL and send it to the other players you'd like to have join. 

Players should use a desktop, laptop or tablet rather than a mobile phone (since phones don't generally have large enough screens to accommodate the UI).

When a player joins, their name will appear in the players list. Once all of the players have joined, click **Start** to begin.


### Deck Building

After you make all of your picks, you'll end up in deck-building mode where you specify which cards will make your main deck and sideboard:

Once you've completed deck-building, click the **View Decklist** button to see a list of the cards in your deck and sideboard. You'll want to select the **MTGA Format** tab to view the list format required by MTGA:

Use the **Copy to Clipboard** button to copy the MTG Arena decklist to the clipboard.

### Playing

Once you've copied your MTG Arena decklist to the clipboard, you can import it into Arena. You can do this in the **Decks** area of Arena (the **Import** button is at the bottom-left of the screen and will automatically import whatever deck is on the clipboard):

MTG Arena games should be initiated using the [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ) feature (accessible by clicking the crossed swords icon at the top right of the home screen):

Direct Challenge supports both Best of 1 and Best of 3 matches. Also, be sure to select the 40-card deck option when setting up the match. You can set both of these options using the **Challenge Options** menu at the top of the pane.
