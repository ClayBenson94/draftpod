## Frequently Asked Questions


##### Where are my previous drafts stored?

Your last several drafts are saved by draftpod within your web browser's local storage. You can review and return to these recent drafts so long as you are using the same browser (if you switch to another browser you won't see the drafts created within the first browser).
