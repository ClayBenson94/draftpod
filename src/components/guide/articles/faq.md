## Frequently Asked Questions


##### How can I practice drafting on my own?

While draftpod single-player mode enables you to practice draft decision making, there is no substitute for playing real matches to learn firsthand how the cards play and interact. If you don't have a friend or group to draft with, the best way to practice on your own is [Magic Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena), which offers a fantastic solo-drafting experience (you draft against bots and then play games against real opponents online).

Magic Arena also offers a [ranking system]() that enables you to track your improvement as a drafter over time, as well increase the quality and challenge of your opponents as your skills progress.

##### What are some good resources for learning how to draft?

One of the best resources for learning how to draft is the [Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/) podcast hosted by Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas. Another excellent podcast dedicated exclusively to Magic draft is [Lords of Limited](https://lordsoflimited.libsyn.com/). 

Ben Stark has a set of articles introducing booster draft as well as covering intermediate and advanced drafting techniques:

* Article 1
* Article 2
* Article 3

Wizards of the Coast has an archive of [articles on drafting]() they've published over the years on their website.

The [Channel Fireball]() and [Star City Games]() websites also both feature a steady stream of articles on drafting (covering both recent sets as well as overall strategy).

You can also sit on the shoulder of the some of the very best Magic players in the world as they draft by watching streams and/or YouTube videos. 

##### Where are my previous drafts stored?

Your last several drafts are saved by draftpod within your web browser's local storage. You can review and return to these recent drafts so long as you are using the same browser (if you switch to another browser you won't see the drafts created within the first browser).
