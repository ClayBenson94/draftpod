## Frequently Asked Questions


##### How can I practice drafting on my own?

While draftpod single-player mode enables you to practice draft decision making, there is no substitute for playing real matches to learn firsthand how the cards play and interact. If you don't have a friend or group to draft with, the best way to practice on your own is [Magic Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena), which offers a fantastic solo-drafting experience (you draft against bots and then play games against real opponents online).

##### What are some good online resources for learning how to draft?

One of the best resources for learning how to draft is the [Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/) podcast hosted by Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas. Another excellent podcast dedicated exclusively to Magic draft is the [Lords of Limited](https://lordsoflimited.libsyn.com/).

##### Where are my previous drafts stored?

Your last several drafts are saved by draftpod within your web browser's local storage. You can review and return to these recent drafts so long as you are using the same browser (if you switch to another browser you won't see the drafts created within the first browser).
