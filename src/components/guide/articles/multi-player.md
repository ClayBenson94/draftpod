## Multi-Player Drafts

Multi-player mode enables you to conduct a simulated 8-person draft even when you have only have 2 or 3 actual players available. While there are other ways to draft with a small handful of players, they inevitably compromise on depth and quantity of available cards, so aren't nearly as rich in strategy (and fun!) as a full draft. Draftpod multi-player mode lets you draft with a friend or small group in a fashion that feels much more like a real 8-player draft.

In multi-player mode you conduct the draft online (along with draft bots that fill in an 8 person table), and then use the resulting decklists to assemble decks from paper magic cards that you already have. 

### Getting Started

To use draftpod for a multi-player draft you'll need to specify exactly what paper _cardpool_ you are drafting from. This is so that the packs built for the draft accurately reflect the paper cards you have on hand. There are a number of techniques for assembling a cardpool which are covered in the [Creating a Set Cube]() article. You'll need to consult this article before hosting a multi-player draft, but for remainder of this article we'll assume that we already have a cardpool to draft from.

To start a new multi-player draft, go to the [Draft](/draft/) page, select the set you want to draft from and the _cardpool_ are drafting from, then choose **Multiple Players**:

</p>

Then, copy the provided URL and send it to the other players you'd like to have join you. Once a player joins their  name will appear in the players list. 

Once all of the players have joined, click **Start Draft** to begin.

After you make all of your picks, you'll end up in deckbuilding mode where you can specify which cards will make your main deck and sideboard. Once you've completed deckbuilding, click the **View Decklist** button to see a list of the cards in your deck and sideboard:

</p>

You can then pull these cards from your physical cardpool and begin playing. Note that the decklist is presented in collector number order (i.e. by color, ordered alphabetically within each color). If you sort/store your cardpool in this order it only takes a couple of minutes to pull out the cards.

### Draft Cardpools

In order to draft online and then play with physical cards, draftpod needs to know exactly which cards you have in your cardpool. There are a number of approaches to building cardpools, including:

1. Including every card in the set (for example, 3 of each common, 2 of each uncommon, and 1 of each rare and mythic rare). This provides for great variety but it can be challenging to collect a complete set!

2. Creating a card pool from a large inventory of cards (e.g. 2 booster boxes). This typically results in reasonably good variety (at least 3 of each common and 2 of nearly all uncommons, with a dozen or so rares and mythics not available).

3. Creating a card pool from a smaller inventory of cards (e.g. a single booster box). This results in less variety but still enough so to preserve the fun and challenge of booster draft.

You can use any set of Magic cards with draftpod so long as they are from the same set and you have at least 384 of them (8 players x 3 boosters x 15 cards/booster).

See the article on [Creating a Set Cube]() for more details on how to create custom cubes and register them for play on draftpod.

### Pick Timer

In a multi-player draft it's sometimes desirable to apply a time limit for each pick to ensure that players aren't waiting an inordinate amount of time for packs. You can enable a pick timer in draftpod when creating a new draft:

</p>

The time limit will be 1 minute, 15 seconds for the first pick in each pack, and then 5 seconds less for each pick thereafter. If the pick timer expires then the draftpod bot logic will be used to automatically make a pick.

### Players at the Table

In a multi-player draft, you'll have a mix of real drafters and draft bots at the table. You can see whom is at the table and where they are seated using the **Players** menu on the navigation bar:

#### Removing a Player

If one of the players needs to leave the draft before it completes, you will need to remove them from the draft in order for the other players to continue (otherwise they'll just end up waiting forever for the player to pass their packs). The host player is able to remove other players by hovering over them in the **Players** view and clicking the **Remove** icon:
