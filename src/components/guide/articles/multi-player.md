## Multi-Player Drafts

Multi-player mode enables you to conduct a simulated 8-person draft even when you have only have 2 or 3 actual players available. While there are other ways to draft with a small handful of players, they inevitably compromise on depth and quantity of available cards, so aren't nearly as rich in strategy as a full draft. Draftpod multi-player mode lets you draft with a friend or small group in a fashion that feels much more like a real 8-player draft.

In multi-player mode you conduct the draft online (along with draft bots that fill in an 8 person table), and then use the resulting decklist to build a deck using paper magic cards you already have. Then you are ready to play some matches! For 2 player drafts you might try best of 3 or 5; for 3 player drafts you might try a round-robin or double-elimination bracket.

There is some setup required for multi-player mode, all of which is covered below.

### Draft Cardpools

While you'll be drafting online, you'll ultimately need to have paper Magic cards to play your matches. Each draft therefore requires the specification of a _cardpool_ of eligible cards (consisting of the paper cards you have available for play).

To assemble a cardpool and use it with Draftpod you need to take the following steps:

1. Identify the cards you want to use (they should all be from a single Magic set).

2. Sort the cards by collector number (the small number that appers in the bottom left of the card). This is essentially sorting the cards by color (with cards ordered alphabetically within each color).
3. Catalog the list of cards (and their quantitites) into a Decked Builder collection, then upload the collection to Draftpod.
4. When you are done drafting, pull the cards you need to build your deck from the cardpool. This is quite straightforward since Draftpod produces decklists ordered by collector number, which will be the order you store your cards in.

This may sound like a lot of work, but all in all typically requires only 3 or 4 hours to create a cardpool you can use over and over again for many drafts. Let's take a closer look at each of these steps.

#### Selecting Cards

The cards within a cardpool need to all come from the same Magic set. Furthermore, you need at least 384 cards in a cardpool (8 players x 3 boosters x 15 cards/booster). In an ideal world, a cardpool will also have an equal number of each card in a set (note that you'll need a smaller number of the higher rarity cards because they appear less frequently in booster packs). Having equal numbers of each card means that the cardpool will have no inherent bias towards specific cards, colors, or archetypes.

That said, it can be quite difficult to collect all of the cards in a set so your cardpool may not achieve a perfect balance. In our experience, if you purchase 2 booster boxes for a given set (72 packs) you will be able to assemble a cardpool that has 3 of each common, 2 of nearly all of the uncommons, and 1 of a significant majority of rares and mythics.

It's ultimately up to you how to balance considerations of cost and variety when composing a cardpool. You can certainly build a cardpool from a single booster box and have lots of fun drafting it, it just won't have quite the same variety as one built from more cards.

#### Ordering and Cataloging

Once you've assmbled the cards, you need to sort them by collector number (which appears in the bottom left hand corder of each cards). The most efficient way to do this is typically to first sort by color, and then sort by collector number within each color.

Once the cards are ordered, you need to enter them into a [Decked Builder]() collection. Note that you aren't strictly required to use Decked Builder, it's just the most straightforward alternative (details on using other methods are provided below). 

Decked Builder includes a set entry mode that will allow you to quickly enter the quantity of each card you have. 



#### Uploading to Draftpod











To conduct a multi-player draft, you first need to assemble a set of Magic cards to draft from (a "cardpool"). There are a few requirements for the cardpool:

- The cards should be from one of draftpod's supported sets.

- All of the cards in the pool should be from a single set (no mixing of sets within a single cardpool).

- You need at least 384 cards in the cardpool (8 players x 3 boosters x 15 cards/booster)

- Your cardpool will ideally have an even number of each common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare in the set. For example,4 of each common, 3 of each uncommon, and 1 of each rare and mythic. This isn't required, but you will have a more varied drafting experience with an even distribution of cards.

- That said, you can also simply buy a Booster Box of the set you want to draft and use that as your cardpool, or
even just assemble whatever extra cards you have on hand from the set. It's always better to have a complete set of all the cards but certainly not required.

Once you've assembled your cardpool, you should organize it by card collector number (cards in each Magic set are numbered sequentially). This will make it easier to pull out the cards to build your deck after you've  completed the draft. 

When creating a multi-player draft, you'll also need to tell draftpod which cards are in your pool. If you've built a pool with an even number of the various rarities then there is likely an option that covers your pool (e.g. 4/4/1/1, 4/4/2/1, 3/3/1/1, etc.) so you won't need to manually enter a list of your cards.

However, if you've built a custom cardpool (e.g. from a Booster Box) then you should enter the cards in your pool into a [Decked Builder](http://www.deckedbuilder.com/) collection. Once you've done this you can export the collection to a CSV file and then upload it to draftpod when defining your cardpool.

Once draftpod knows about your cardpool you are ready to draft. After the draft completes you can download a decklist, pull those cards out of the cardpool, and play your games!
