## Multi-Player

Multi-player mode enables you to conduct a simulated 8-person draft even when you have only have 2 or 3 actual players available. While there are other ways to draft with a small handful of players, they inevitably compromise on depth and quantity of available cards, so aren't nearly as rich in strategy (and fun!) as a full draft. Multi-player mode lets you draft with a friend or small group in a fashion that feels much more like a real 8-player draft.

In multi-player mode you conduct the draft online (along with draft bots that fill in an 8 person table), and then use the resulting deck lists to either assemble decks from a paper set cube, or play games online using MTG Arena [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ).

To play using paper cards, you will need to [create a cube](/guide/#cardpools) for the set you are drafting. To play games on MTG Arena, you will need to have a reasonably complete collection of cards (and/or available wildcards) for the set you are playing with.

### Drafting

To start a new multi-player draft, go to the [Play](/play/) page, select the set you want to draft and the _cardpool_ you are drafting from (this is so that the packs built for the draft accurately reflect the cards you have available to play with):

</p>

For playing with paper cards, see the [Cardpools](/guide#cardpools/) article for additonal details on building a cardpool. If you are playing with MTG Arena, you'll typically want to specify 4x of commons and uncommons, and 1x of each rare and mythic.

Then, choose the **Multiple Players** option:

<p>

</p>

Finally, copy the provided URL and send it to the other players you'd like to have join. 

Players should use a desktop, laptop or tablet rather than a mobile phone (since phones don't generally have large enough screens to accommodate the UI).

When a player joins, their name will appear in the players list. Once all of the players have joined, click **Start** to begin.


### Deck Building

After you make all of your picks, you'll end up in deck-building mode where you can specify which cards will make your main deck and sideboard:

<img src="/images/guide/deck-builder.png" width="100%" />
</p>

Once you've completed deck-building, click the **View Decklist** button to see a list of the cards in your deck and sideboard:

<p>
<img src="/images/guide/multi-player-decklist.png" width="100%" />
</p>

If you are playing with paper cards, you can then pull these cards from your cardpool and begin playing. Note that the decklist is presented in collector number order (i.e. by color, ordered alphabetically within each color). If you sort/store your cardpool in this order it only takes a couple of minutes to pull out the cards.

If you are playing using MTG Arena [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ), you should select **MTGA Format**, copy your decklist to the clipboard, then import it into MTGA before playing:

</p>


### Playing on Arena

To play games on MTG Arena, you will need to have a reasonably complete collection of cards (and/or available wildcards) for the set you are drafting from. If you play and draft frequently on Arena, it's likely that your collection is already complete enough.

Once you've copied your MTG Arena decklist to the clipboard, you can import it into Arena. You can do this in the **Decks** area of Arena (the **Import** button is at the bottom-left of the screen and will automatically import whatever deck is on the clipboard):


<p>
<img src="/images/guide/arena-deck-import.png" width="100%" />
</p>


MTG Arena games should be initiated using the [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ) feature, which supports both best of 1 and best of 3 matches.

Note that Direct Challenge requires 60 card decks, whereas limited decks are 40 cards. To bridge this gap, MTG Arena decklists automatically expand your 40 card draft or sealed deck to 60 cards. For example, if you have 23 non-lands in your deck, 13 of them (selected at random) will be duplicated so that you end up with 36 non-lands. Note that the ratio between creatures and non-creatures in your deck will be preserved.

### Playing in Person

In order to draft online and then play with physical cards, you need to specify exactly which cards you have in your cardpool. There are a number of approaches to building cardpools, including:

1. Including every card in the set (for example, 3 of each common, 2 of each uncommon, and 1 of each rare and mythic rare). This provides for great variety but it can be challenging to collect a complete set!

2. Creating a card pool from a large inventory of cards (e.g. 2 booster boxes). This typically results in reasonably good variety (at least 3 of each common and 2 of nearly all uncommons, with a dozen or so rares and mythics not available).

3. Creating a card pool from a smaller inventory of cards (e.g. a single booster box). This results in less variety but still enough so to preserve the fun and challenge of booster draft.

You can use any set of Magic cards so long as they are from the same set and you have at least 384 of them (8 players x 3 boosters x 15 cards/booster).

See the article on [Cardpools](/guide#cardpools/) for more details on how to create a cardpool and register it for play.

### Pick Timer

In a multi-player draft it's sometimes desirable to apply a time limit for each pick to ensure that players aren't waiting an inordinate amount of time for packs. You can enable a pick timer when creating a new draft:

<p>
<img src="/images/guide/pick-timer.png" width="100%" />
</p>

The time limit will be 1 minute, 15 seconds for the first pick in each pack, and then 5 seconds less for each pick thereafter. If the pick timer expires then the default draft bot logic will be used to automatically make a pick.

### Players at the Table

In a multi-player draft, you'll have a mix of real drafters and draft bots at the table. You can see whom is at the table and where they are seated using the **Players** menu on the navigation bar:

</p>

#### Removing a Player

If one of the players needs to leave the draft before it completes, you will need to remove them from the draft in order for the other players to continue (otherwise they'll just end up waiting forever for the player to pass their packs). The host player is able to remove other players by hovering over them in the **Players** view and clicking the **Remove** icon:
