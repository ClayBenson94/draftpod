## Multi-Player Drafts

To conduct a multi-player draft, you first need to assemble a set of Magic cards to draft from (a "cardpool"). There are a few requirements for the cardpool:

- The cards should be from one of draftpod's supported sets.

- All of the cards in the pool should be from a single set (no mixing of sets within a single cardpool).

- You need at least 384 cards in the cardpool (8 players x 3 boosters x 15 cards/booster)

- Your cardpool will ideally have an even number of each common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare in the set. For example,4 of each common, 3 of each uncommon, and 1 of each rare and mythic. This isn't required, but you will have a more varied drafting experience with an even distribution of cards.

- That said, you can also simply buy a Booster Box of the set you want to draft and use that as your cardpool, or
even just assemble whatever extra cards you have on hand from the set. It's always better to have a complete set of all the cards but certainly not required.

Once you've assembled your cardpool, you should organize it by card collector number (cards in each Magic set are numbered sequentially). This will make it easier to pull out the cards to build your deck after you've  completed the draft. 

When creating a multi-player draft, you'll also need to tell draftpod which cards are in your pool. If you've built a pool with an even number of the various rarities then there is likely an option that covers your pool (e.g. 4/4/1/1, 4/4/2/1, 3/3/1/1, etc.) so you won't need to manually enter a list of your cards.

However, if you've built a custom cardpool (e.g. from a Booster Box) then you should enter the cards in your pool into a [Decked Builder](http://www.deckedbuilder.com/) collection. Once you've done this you can export the collection to a CSV file and then upload it to draftpod when defining your cardpool.

Once draftpod knows about your cardpool you are ready to draft. After the draft completes you can download a decklist, pull those cards out of the cardpool, and play your games!
