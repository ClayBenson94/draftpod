## Sealed Deck

[Sealed Deck](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/sealed-deck) is another popular limited format. Sealed is the format used in MTG [Pre-Release](https://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/prerelease) events, and is also used on Day 1 of [Grand Prix](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-event-types-events) limited tournaments. Sealed was also used in the swiss rounds of [Pro Tour Qualifier](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Pro_Tour_Qualifier) limited events.

Sealed typically provides 6 booster packs from which players build a 40-card deck. This provides a distinct challenge from booster draft, and often requires running 3 or more colors to maximize the number of strong playables in your deck. You can also play sealed with more than 6 packs (e.g. 10 or 12 packs), which enables you to build decks with a level of coherence and synergy comparable to the ones built in booster draft.

Draftpod sealed deck mode also supports multiple players, which is a great way to get replay value out of a booster box (keep creating virtual sealed pools from the cards opened in the booster box) or to use MTG Arena Direct Challenge with a fresh deck building challenge every time you play.

### Getting Started

To get started with sealed, go to the [Play](/play/) page, select the set you want to use, specify **Sealed Deck** for the format, and click the **Start** button (it's fine to accept the defaults for the other options):

</p>

Assuming you used the default of 6 packs, you'll be allocated a pool of 90 cards which you can browse and build a deck from:

</p>

The sealed pool is displayed on top, and the cards currently selected from the pool for your deck are displayed below. You can move cards between your sealed pool and deck either by clicking them or via drag and drop. Note that you can also drag cards to your sideboard if they aren't in your deck yet but still under strong consideration.

### Cardpool Navigation

One of the first things you'll want to do with a new sealed pool is browse all of the cards in the pool. You can do this by using the paging controls at the top of the screen:

</p>

You can also use the **Left Arrow** and **Right Arrow** keys to navigate between pages.

#### Filtering

You'll often want to filter the cardpool so that e.g. only cards of certain colors are displayed, only rares and uncommons are displayed, etc. You can do this using the **Filter** popup. For example, here we set the filter to only show blue and white cards that have _+1/+1 counter_ in their rules text:
