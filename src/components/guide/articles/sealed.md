## Sealed Deck

[Sealed Deck](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/sealed-deck) is another popular limited format. Sealed is the format used in MTG [Pre-Release](https://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/prerelease) events, and is also used on Day 1 of [Grand Prix](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-event-types-events) limited tournaments. Sealed is also the format for swiss rounds of [Pro Tour Qualifier](https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Pro_Tour_Qualifier) limited events.

Sealed typically provides 6 booster packs from which players build a 40-card deck. This provides a distinct challenge from booster draft, and often requires running 3 or more colors to maximize the number of strong playables in your deck. You can also play sealed with more than 6 packs (e.g. 10 or 12 packs), which enables you to build decks with a level of coherence and synergy comparable to the ones built in booster draft.

Sealed deck mode also supports multiple players, which is a great way to get replay value out of a booster box (keep creating virtual sealed pools from the cards opened in the booster box) or to use MTG Arena Direct Challenge with a fresh deck building challenge every time you play.

### Getting Started

To get started with sealed, go to the [Play](/play/) page, select the set you want to use, specify **Sealed Deck** for the format, and click the **Start** button (it's fine to accept the defaults for the other options):

</p>

Assuming you used the default of 6 packs, you'll be allocated a pool of 90 cards which you can browse and build a deck from:

</p>

The sealed pool is displayed on top, and the cards currently selected from the pool for your deck are displayed below. You can move cards between your sealed pool and deck either by clicking them or via drag and drop. Note that you can also drag cards to your sideboard if they aren't in your deck yet but still under strong consideration.

### Cardpool Navigation

One of the first things you'll want to do with a new sealed pool is browse all of the cards in the pool. You can do this by using the paging controls at the top of the screen:

</p>

You can also use the **Left Arrow** and **Right Arrow** keys to navigate between pages.

#### Filtering

You'll often want to filter the cardpool so that e.g. only cards of certain colors are displayed, only rares and uncommons are displayed, etc. You can do this using the **Filter** popup. For example, here we set the filter to only show blue and white cards that have _+1/+1 counter_ in their rules text:

### Deck Building

As illustrated above, as you select cards from your sealed pool for your deck, you will see them displayed in the bottom pane, arranged by converted mana cost. It is sometimes also useful to see a view of your deck with creature spells separated from non-creature spells. Click the button at the far right of the deck pane to see a full screen display of your deck:

Once you've completed deck-building, click the **View Decklist** button to see a list of the cards in your deck and sideboard:

<p>

</p>

If you are playing with paper cards, you can then pull these cards from your cardpool and begin playing. Note that the decklist is presented in collector number order (i.e. by color, ordered alphabetically within each color). If you sort/store your cardpool in this order it only takes a couple of minutes to pull out the cards.

If you are playing using MTG Arena [Direct Challenge](https://mtgarena-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001447063-Direct-Challenge-FAQ), you should select **MTGA Format**, copy your decklist to the clipboard, then import it into MTGA before playing:
