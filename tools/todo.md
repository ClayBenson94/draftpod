- import Decked Builder YAML (.coll2)

- ensure that 15 cards per pack isn't a hard coded thing (it probably is in the pick timer and upload)
- error if we don't fill all the packs? (otherwise exposed on completed calculations)

- once we get into deckbuilder mode we stop polling for expired picks which means that
  abandoned players don't complete their picks (this may be fine, let's just make sure)

- sideboard:
    - automatic ordering?
    - drop targets to deck not big enough
    - trash/hide/second pile (pile which won't be in decklist) 
    - additional 'unused pile'

- sane tablet experience

- at larger deck sizes during building it's possible for a color
  to be auto-assigned 0 mana even though there is a card in that color
  (fraction is likely too small)

- ability to see the other players at the table in multiplayer

- ability to see other players colors / rewind in single player

- log all picks 

- disconnect/delete after multiplayer draft

- GRPD analysis
