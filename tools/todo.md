- when writing / reading to firestore, "compress" the cards by just including
  the multiverse id. could also be used for local storage?

- favicon

- remove mana and set symbols?

- import Decked Builder YAML (.coll2)

- sideboard:
    - automatic ordering?
    - drop targets to deck not big enough
    - trash/hide/second pile (pile which won't be in decklist) 

- sane tablet experience

- at larger deck sizes during building it's possible for a color
  to be auto-assigned 0 mana even though there is a card in that color
  (fraction is likely too small)
