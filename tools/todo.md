  
- sideboard:

    - automatic ordering?
    - drop targets to deck not big enough
    - additional 'unused pile' (pile which won't be in decklist) 


- player view:

    - ability to see the other players at the table in multiplayer
    - ability to see other players colors after the draft in single player
    - ability to rewind draft?
    - let the host remove players (rather than distributed pick timer)

- general:

    - we still get a 400 error during the initialization sequence for multiplayer
    - if we cancel a single player multiplayer draft name validation still occurs
    - some progress treatment for joining/connecting?
    - improve name of decklist download file (set/date/colors/etc)
