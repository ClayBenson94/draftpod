- tablet/mobile:

    - width of elements on navigator screen
    - view decklist not download/copy

- sideboard:

    - automatic ordering?
    - drop targets to deck not big enough
    - additional 'unused pile' (pile which won't be in decklist) 

- flashback: 

    - sometimes we see a past state then we flash back to our current state
    - during flash-back you can double-pick a card
    - if a user loses the network connection then everyone is stuck waiting
    - should we consider only committing after the server verifies? that would
      imply turning all of the mutations into actions and having some sort
      of global waiting/progress treatment

- player view:

    - ability to see the other players at the table in multiplayer
    - ability to see other players colors after the draft in single player
    - ability to rewind draft?
    - let the host remove players (rather than distributed pick timer)

- general:

    - some progress treatment for joining/connecting?
