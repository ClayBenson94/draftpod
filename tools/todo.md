- general

    - still get a flashback effect. we could up the debounce?
    - any more prevention of picks required? (already prevent duplicates)
    - the only good way around this might be to save operations and apply them
      rather than updating the whole table as a monolith
    

- player view:

    - let the host remove players (rather than distributed pick timer)
