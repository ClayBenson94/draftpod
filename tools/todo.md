- favicon

- remove mana and set symbols?

- import Decked Builder YAML (.coll2)

- sideboard:
    - automatic ordering?
    - drop targets to deck not big enough
    - trash/hide/second pile (pile which won't be in decklist) 

- compressed representation for local storage?

- sane tablet experience

- at larger deck sizes during building it's possible for a color
  to be auto-assigned 0 mana even though there is a card in that color
  (fraction is likely too small)

- we do get the 400 error due to multiple requests in flight when multiplayer
  drafts are created. See if we can consolidate some of these operations.

- sane ui when you are invited to a draft but they don't yet have a username

- ability to see the other players at the table in multiplayer

- ability to see other players colors / rewind in single player

- log all picks in google storage

- remove unused firebase config
