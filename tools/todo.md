- pack 1, pick 1 in second pack

- when a user is offlline or has weak connectivity then a lot of rewinds happen

- had to go back to moving picks to deck at the end of all picks
  (were getting stranded with 44 picks so never firing on picksComplete)

- auto-pick needs to check if there is a pack

- import Decked Builder YAML (.coll2)

- sideboard:
    - automatic ordering?
    - drop targets to deck not big enough
    - trash/hide/second pile (pile which won't be in decklist) 
    - additional 'unused pile'

- sane tablet experience

- at larger deck sizes during building it's possible for a color
  to be auto-assigned 0 mana even though there is a card in that color
  (fraction is likely too small)

- ability to see the other players at the table in multiplayer

- ability to see other players colors / rewind in single player

- log all picks 

- disconnect/delete after multiplayer draft
