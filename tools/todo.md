- import Decked Builder YAML (.coll2)

- sideboard:
    - automatic ordering?
    - drop targets to deck not big enough
    - trash/hide/second pile (pile which won't be in decklist) 
    - additional 'unused pile'

- sane tablet experience

- at larger deck sizes during building it's possible for a color
  to be auto-assigned 0 mana even though there is a card in that color
  (fraction is likely too small)

- we do get the 400 error due to multiple requests in flight when multiplayer
  drafts are created. See if we can consolidate some of these operations.

- ability to see the other players at the table in multiplayer

- ability to see other players colors / rewind in single player

- log all picks 

- disconnect/delete after multiplayer draft
