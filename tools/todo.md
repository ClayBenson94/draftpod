- timeout pick timer very likely resulting in multiple picks! get rid of it

- fail to import all of the card faces for Unstable:
    - Novellamenta - 98
    - Secret Base - 162

    - Target Minatour - 189
    - Amatuer Auteur - 203
    - Curious Killbot - 208
    - Beast in Show - 209

- Unstable uncommonNotContraption needs to be able to use bootser.uncommon
  (filters.join needs to handle multiple)

- sideboard:
    - automatic ordering?
    - drop targets to deck not big enough
    - trash/hide/second pile (pile which won't be in decklist) 
    - additional 'unused pile'

- contraptions pile for unstable?

- sane tablet experience
   - native touch event support; OR
   - https://github.com/kutlugsahin/vue-smooth-dnd

- ability to see the other players at the table in multiplayer
- ability to see other players colors after the draft in single player
- ability to rewind draft?
- consider moving away from distributed pick timer and let the host remove players
