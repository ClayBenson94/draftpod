[Draftpod](https://draftpod.org) provides a simulator that enables you to conduct Magic the Gathering
[booster drafts](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft) 
with 2 or 3 players, in which case simulated players (draft bots) take the other seats
at the table. When the draft is complete, you use the resulting decklists to assemble 
decks from paper magic cards in your collection, and then play some games!

Draftpod also includes a single-player mode that enables you to practice evaluating 
cards, reading signals, and building decks. Our hope is that Draftpod will provide 
a great way for 2, 3, or 4 players to draft without compromising on the depth of 
strategy and skill that makes drafting such a great gaming experience. We also hope
it will be a valuable learning resource for players trying to improve their skills.
